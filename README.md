# Kotlin Basics

## Introduction

Welcome to the Kotlin Basics Project! This repository is dedicated to helping beginners learn the fundamental concepts of Kotlin, a modern programming language that is concise, expressive, and designed to be type- and null-safe. Kotlin is widely used for Android development and also applicable in a variety of other contexts like server-side, web, and native applications.

## What is Kotlin?

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language developed by JetBrains. It is fully interoperable with Java and focuses on safety, clarity, and tooling support. Kotlin can be used for building Android apps, server-side applications, and much more.

## Getting Started

To start using Kotlin, you will need to set up your development environment. You can write Kotlin code in IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, or any other IDE that supports Kotlin.

### Installation

1. Download and install [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
2. Install the Kotlin plugin if it's not already included in your IDE.
3. Configure your project to use Kotlin (see specific instructions for your IDE).

### Writing Your First Kotlin Program

Create a new Kotlin file (`Main.kt`, for example) and paste the following code:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Hello, Kotlin!")
}
