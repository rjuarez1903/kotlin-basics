# Kotlin Basics

## Introduction
Welcome to the Kotlin Basics Project! This repository aims to introduce beginners to the fundamental concepts of Kotlin, a modern, safe, and expressive programming language. Kotlin is versatile, being applicable in Android, server-side, web, and native development.

## What is Kotlin?
Kotlin is a statically typed language developed by JetBrains, interoperable with Java, focusing on safety and clarity. It's suitable for a range of applications, from Android apps to server-side solutions.

## Getting Started
To use Kotlin, set up your development environment:
1. Install IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio.
2. Install the Kotlin plugin (if not included).
3. Configure your project for Kotlin (refer to your IDE's instructions).

## Project Structure
The project is structured with various Kotlin files under `src/main/kotlin`. Each file explores different Kotlin concepts and sometimes draws comparisons with Java and JavaScript. Most files contain a `main` function for execution, except for some class definitions.

## Running the Examples
- Each Kotlin file can be run independently.
- Files typically include a `main` function to demonstrate concepts.
- Explore each file to understand different facets of Kotlin programming.

## Comparison with Other Languages
- Where applicable, Kotlin concepts are compared with Java and JavaScript.
- This approach aids in understanding differences and advantages of Kotlin.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome, especially from those who are new to Kotlin and wish to share their learning experiences.
